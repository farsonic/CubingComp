## CubingComp

Throughout the course of our local lockdown I will be generating scrambles for the following cube categories. 

* 2x2
* 3x3
* 4x4
* 5x5 
* 3x3OH
* Pyraminx

At this stage the competition is self scrambled and recorded as a minimum. If you want external scramblers and judging then time to teach your co-inhabinants how to scramble a cube :) 

Scrambles are being uploaded to github at aproximatly 8am ADST for each day. 

I have created a google sheet at the following URL. You will need to request access to this spreadsheet before you can access and make changes. Please duplicate the "blank contestant" tab for the new contestant and please only modify your own individual results.

## Known issues 
Calculations for worst/best times for 5x5 isn't functional yet. Time is entered in minutes/seconds/milliseconds as the following format 03:45.11 (three minutes, 45.11 seconds)
